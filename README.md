# A minimal reproducible example of [This issue](https://github.com/razzmatazz/csharp-language-server/issues/260)

## Usage

Open `Program.cs` using `csharp-ls` inside neovim with completion engine configured properly, and wait for project to be load and type anything for completion.
And neovim will have **SUPER HIGH CPU USAGE**.
